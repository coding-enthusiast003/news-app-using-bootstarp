## 🔹 Caching System (Optimized News Fetching)
✔ **How It Works:**

- ✅ **Cache validation:**  
  Uses cached data if it’s available and less than 30 minutes old.  

- 🔄 **Automatic refresh:**  
  Clears outdated cache and fetches fresh news when needed.  

- 🗄️ Caching with MongoDB
Uses MongoDB to store and retrieve recent news data, reducing unnecessary API requests and improving performance.
